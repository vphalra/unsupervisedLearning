<!-- Dataset Overview -->
<section class="mb-4">
    <h4>Dataset Overview</h4>
    <p>The dataset includes demographic variables such as gender, age, marital status, and socioeconomic information.
        It also contains smoking-related behavior variables such as smoking frequency on weekends and weekdays, and
        the type of product used (e.g., packets or hand-rolled cigarettes).</p>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/smoking_variables.png') }}" alt="Dataset Variables Overview"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow" style="width: 400px; height: auto">
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4>Data Sample and Variable Validation</h4>
    <p>Below is a sample of the dataset used in this project. This step ensures the accuracy of data types and highlights
        potential inconsistencies that require preprocessing.</p>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/smoking_data_sample.png') }}" alt="Sample Data"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow" style="width: 700px; height: auto">
</section>

<p>The data types align with each variable except for `gross_income`, which is ordinal rather than numerical. By
    checking the unique values, we confirm the income categories are arranged in ascending order. Note that the dataset
    originates from a UK survey and uses GBP.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/gross_income_unique.png') }}" alt="Gross Income Categories"
     class="img-fluid rounded shadow" style='width: 800px; height: auto'>
<p>Additionally, missing values in smoking-related columns (`amt_weekends`, `amt_weekdays`, and `type`) suggest that
    these NaNs are likely associated with nonsmokers. Letâ€™s quantify these missing values and investigate their
    patterns:</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/na_values.png') }}" alt="Missing Values" class="img-fluid rounded shadow"
     style="width: 500px; height: auto">

<p>Based on our analysis, we treat these NaN values as representing nonsmoking behavior during model development.</p>

<!-- Objective -->
<section class="mb-4">
    <h4>Objective</h4>
    <p>
        The primary objective is to uncover hidden clusters in the dataset by minimizing intra-cluster variance and
        maximizing inter-cluster separation. This will allow us to identify distinct groups of individuals with
        similar smoking behaviors and associated risks.
    </p>
</section>
<!-- End Objective -->
<hr>

<!-- Methods and Techniques -->
<section class="mb-4">
    <h4>Methods and Techniques</h4>
    <p>We applied the following unsupervised learning techniques to achieve the project objectives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> Determined optimal clusters using the elbow method.</li>
        <li><strong>Hierarchical Clustering:</strong> Visualized relationships through a dendrogram.</li>
        <li><strong>PCA (Principal Component Analysis):</strong> Reduced dimensionality and identified key features influencing clusters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The clustering methods were validated using metrics such as silhouette score and ANOVA, with PCA helping to interpret key
    components and feature contributions.</p>
</section>
<hr>

<!-- Results and Findings -->
<section class="mb-4">
    <h4>Results and Findings</h4>
    <p>The clustering model revealed three distinct groups, providing insights into varying smoking behaviors and patterns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cluster 0 (Nonsmokers):</strong> Individuals with no recorded smoking behavior, possibly nonsmokers or low-risk individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Cluster 1 (Moderate Smokers):</strong> Individuals who exhibit moderate smoking behavior, particularly on weekends. This group may require prevention strategies to avoid habit escalation.</li>
        <li><strong>Cluster 2 (High-Risk Smokers):</strong> Consistent and heavy smokers who are likely at greater health risk. Intervention programs should target this group with cessation support and monitoring.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dimensionality reduction through PCA highlighted that over 98% of the variance in the dataset is explained by the first three components. The most influential features were `amt_weekends` and `amt_weekdays`, indicating that smoking frequency across different time periods is a major differentiating factor.</p>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/pca_variance.png') }}" alt="PCA Explained Variance"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow" style="width: 800px; height: auto">

    <p>The loadings on the first principal component reinforce this interpretation:</p>

         class="img-fluid rounded shadow" style="width: 700px; height: auto">
    
    <p>Interestingly, `age` had a secondary but significant contribution, highlighting potential demographic influences on smoking behavior.</p>

<!-- Insights and Recommendations -->
<section class="mb-4">
    <h4>Insights and Recommendations</h4>
    <p>
        The analysis offers important insights for public health intervention:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintain Nonsmoking Behavior:</strong> Early prevention programs should focus on Cluster 0 individuals to ensure they do not develop smoking habits.</li>
        <li><strong>Moderation Programs:</strong> Cluster 1 individuals could benefit from educational campaigns emphasizing the risks of habit escalation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cessation Support:</strong> Intensive support is necessary for Cluster 2, which shows signs of consistent, high-risk smoking behavior.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data Collection Improvements:</strong> Future studies should incorporate additional health indicators (e.g., lung function) to further refine clustering and prediction accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p>
            In this project, I developed an unsupervised clustering model to analyze smoking behavior and uncover hidden
            patterns in a dataset containing demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral variables. The model categorizes
            individuals based on their similarities, providing insights into smoking-related trends and health risk
            segmentation. This approach can inform public health strategies and guide smoking cessation interventions.

        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>
            The objective of this model is to segment data into meaningful clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance
            and maximizing inter-cluster separation. These groupings reveal valuable insights, such as different smoking
            patterns, health risks, and socio-economic influences on behavior.

    <!-- Approach and Techniques -->
    <section class="mb-4">
        <h4>Getting to know the Dataset</h4>
        <p>To begin let's familiarize ourselves with the datasets and the variables included.</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'images/smoking_variables.png') }}" alt="smoking dataset variables"
             class="img-fluid rounded shadow" style="width: 400px; height: auto">
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
        <p>As we can observe from the picture above, there are 12 variables. On the right side of the variables are its
            data types. Let's take a look at a sample of the dataset to verify if these data types are accurate.</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/smoking_data_sample.png') }}" alt="smoking data sample"
             class="img-fluid rounded shadow" style="width: 700px; height: auto">
    </section>

    <p>Overall the data type aligns with each corresponding variable. However, I would like to point out that
        gross income in this dataset is provided as an ordinal variable instead of an integer or a float value. Let's
        check
        for the unique values to understand the order of the ordinal variable (gross_income).
    </p>

    <section class="mb-4">
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/gross_income_unique.png') }}" alt="gross income unique values"
             class="img-fluid rounded shadow" style='width: 800px; height: auto'>
    </section>


    <p>
        Extrapolating the information, we can see that gross income starts at "under 2,600" and incrementally increases
        to "above 36,400". I do want to mention that this dataset is derived from a UK survey, so the currency is in
        GBP.
        Moreover, we can also recognize there are unique values of "unknown" and "refused". "Refused" likely indicates
        that the survey participant opted out of answering this particular question, while "unknown" may suggest either
        a missing response, data entry issue, or that the participant did not know their income range.
    </p>
    <p>Let us now identify variables with NaN values and apply a corresponding treatment.</p>
    <section class="mb-4">
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/na_values.png')  }}" alt = 'na values' class="img-fluid rounded shadow"
     style = "width:500px; height=auto">
</section>
    <p>Based on the screenshot above we can observe that there are three variables with exactly 1270 NaN values.
    What does this mean? Let's dive in deeper to see which category of missingness this belongs to (MCAR, MNAR,
        or MAR).</p>

    <hr>
    <!-- Results and Findings -->
    <section class="mb-4">
        <h4>Results and Findings</h4>
        <p>The model identified the following key clusters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cluster 1:</strong> High-frequency users with large transaction volumes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cluster 2:</strong> Occasional users who show seasonal activity patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Cluster 3:</strong> Users with high engagement but low transaction amounts, potentially
                indicating exploratory behavior.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These clusters provide actionable insights, enabling tailored marketing strategies, targeted offers, and
            improved customer segmentation.

            The insights derived from this model can be applied to various use cases, including customer segmentation,
            fraud detection, and operational efficiency. Future improvements include experimenting with hierarchical
            clustering and DBSCAN to handle noise and outliers more effectively.
